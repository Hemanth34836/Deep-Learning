Project Highlights

Churn Modeling Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Objective: Predicted customer churn for a subscription-based business using an ANN model.

Data Preprocessing:Cleaned and processed customer data, handling missing values and outliers.
Performed feature scaling and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Visualized relationships between customer demographics, tenure, and churn.
Identified key features influencing churn using correlation matrices and feature importance.

Model Architecture:Designed a fully connected ANN with input, hidden, and output layers.
Used ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Business Insights:Predicted customers at high risk of churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.
Recommended personalized offers and loyalty programs based on predicted churn probability.
